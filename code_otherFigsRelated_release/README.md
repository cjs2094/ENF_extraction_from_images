# Code for generating other figures in the paper

## Preparation
* Please download the video dataset named `'imgs_set.zip'` from the following URL: [https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/images-real-enf-traces-and-related-dataset-enf-presence-classification-test](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/images-real-enf-traces-and-related-dataset-enf-presence-classification-test), upzip, and put it under the directory `./code_otherFigsRelated_release/`


## Usage
* For the dataset used in the paper, open each script file named `'main1_fig1de.m'`, `'main2_fig3_simulateUsingVoltageMeasurement.m'`, `'main3_fig4_genSimulatedPixelIntensitySignals.m'`, `'main4_fig5c_overlayENFsigs.m'`, and `'main5_fig7.m'` and run sequentially each section divided by %% to produce figures in the paper
